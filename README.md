# [Calculator](https://github.com/vikas-parmar/calculator/)

## Description
:pushpin: This React-based Calculator project is a web application that allows users to perform mathematical calculations in a user-friendly interface. The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it utilizes modern web development technologies such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
<br />
Users can input numbers and operators using the calculator buttons, and the app displays the result of the calculation in real-time. The app can support basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
